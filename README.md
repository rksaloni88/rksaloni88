## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm a DevOps and Cloud enthusiast with a passion for optimizing, automating, and streamlining complex deployment processes. With hands-on experience in **AWS** and **Kubernetes**, I enjoy developing reliable and scalable infrastructure solutions, especially when it comes to CI/CD and infrastructure as code.

## 🛠️ Key Skills

- **Cloud**: AWS (ECS, EC2, Lambda, S3, CloudWatch, Athena, Amazon MQ)
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Spinnaker, AWS CodePipeline, GitLab CI/CD
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm
- **Scripting and Programming**: Python, Golang
- **Monitoring**: Datadog, ELK, CloudWatch
- **Cost Optimization**: Implemented cost-effective alternatives and optimizations using OpenResty and Lua scripting in place of NGINX+ modules

## 💼 Experience Highlights

- Spearheaded CRM product development and optimized deployments with Docker and Kubernetes
- Automated and optimized CI/CD pipelines across multiple projects
- Successfully migrated IBM Netezza Cloud data to AWS, automating data movement and transformation with AWS Glue and Lambda
- Led initiatives in cost optimization and infrastructure automation with Terraform, Python, and shell scripting

## 🚀 Current Projects

I'm currently focusing on projects involving **infrastructure automation** with Terraform, **event-driven architecture** using AmazonMQ and Kafka, and **CI/CD optimization** for cloud-native applications.

## 🌱 On My Radar

I'm always excited to explore new tools and methodologies in DevOps, cloud architecture, and serverless computing, as well as contributing to open-source projects that align with my expertise.
